Pixels Rich Presence is an extension that enhances the user experience by integrating in-game activity from Pixels Game with Discord Rich Presence. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how your data is handled.


### Data Collection

Pixels Rich Presence only collects the following types of data:

- **User Preferences**: We store simple settings, such as whether Rich Presence is enabled or disabled, to improve the user experience by ensuring preferences are saved between sessions.
- **In-Game Events**: The extension captures map changes, to display relevant information on your Discord profile.

### How We Use the Data

- **User Preferences**: The preferences collected are solely used to persist your settings within the extension, ensuring that your preferences (e.g., enabling or disabling Rich Presence) are maintained between sessions.
- **In-Game Events**: In-game data is only used to update your Discord Rich Presence status in real-time. This data is not shared with third parties.

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: User preferences are stored locally within the browser using Chromeâ€™s storage API. This data is not transmitted to any remote servers.
- **Server Communication**: In-game events are communicated to your local self hosted server application and are used to update your Discord status. No user data is stored or sent outside of your local environment.

### Third-Party Sharing
